This is the repo for my "Year of Python" project.

To help stregthen my understanding of Python, I've decided to write one piece of Python Code
(script, snippet, etc) every week for 2015.  I'm going to put my code weekly in this repo.

My plan is to have the code up by Sunday of each week (in my world the week starts on Monday).

YOP - Week 1	Parse NTUSER.DAT keys
YOP - Week 2	Download VXShare Hash Files
YOP - Week 3	Generate random decimal, binary, and hex numbers
